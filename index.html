        <h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cough Detection Model with Transfer Learning for COVID-19 and Flu Identification:</strong>
        Developing a transfer learning-based model to detect and differentiate between healthy, COVID-19, and flu coughs for thesis research.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Disease Outcome Prediction:</strong>
        Analyzed a comprehensive dataset comprising symptoms, demographics, and health indicators. 
        Evaluated the performance of Linear Regression and Decision Tree models for disease prediction, achieving 72.86% accuracy with Decision Tree, outperforming Multiple Linear Regression at 57.14%.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Impact of Time and Location on Education Spending:</strong>
        Conducted statistical analysis using SAS to examine U.S. education spending trends over time and across locations. 
        Found no significant change over time using matched-pair analysis and identified state-level disparities through ANOVA.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>YouTube as a Learning Tool to Improve Speaking Skills:</strong>
        Built a web application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQLite, and Django to enhance students' speaking skills. 
        Integrated features like curated video content, Google Translator for language translation, and a chatbot for 24/7 interactive support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Facial Recognition to Detect Mood and Suggest Songs Accordingly:</strong>
        Developed a mood-based music recommendation system using facial recognition (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Haar Cascade) and music mood prediction models (Tf-Idf, Random Forest). 
        Achieved 98.1% training and 92.4% testing accuracy for facial recognition, and 74.6% accuracy for music mood prediction. 
        Published findings in a Springer Conference paper through collaboration with a research team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prediction of Placement of Various Candidates Using 3 Models:</strong>
        Proposed a methodology to predict placement outcomes of candidates using KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models. 
        Obtained 88.41% accuracy with the Random Forest model, demonstrating its effectiveness in the given scenario.
